Accomplished:
Resizing graph, reverted both graphs to VisNetwork types. I also abstracted some methods for getting data for less complexity
I removed a lot of old code, and simplified some function calls
I added more layering to the bipartite graph, and found a way to highlight nodes more effectively.
The coloring seems buggy, but now nodes are distinctly viewable

Trying to accomplish:
Resizing nodes based on graph type, calling fewer methods to ascertain data.
I'd love to find a way to make bipartite graphs easier to read, and start them more zoomed in
It seems line thickness is also tricky, as you cannot go much thinner than the default - perhaps
changing opacity would be better?
Finally, I worked with the canvas size but failed to make it any bigger

Accomplished:
Met with Charlie and discussed progress, reorganized bipartite/force-directed inputs during meeting

Fixed two-way viewing of nodes/edges, and i'm currently changing edge colors to give contrast between nodes and edges. Also playing with opacity for edges

Accomplished:
Re-writing code to remove getNutr() and getNodes(), to have one main method that returns nutr and nodes
Re-wrote UI elements to put graph and selectors into one box, allowing for multiple graphs to exist

Accomplished:
Fitting two graphs into one page via some extra html and a conditionalpanel. Currently, the second graph does render, but is hidden. Also, the controls for the second graph do not work.

Trying to accomplish:
Fixing functionality for second graph, making it obey its own check boxes. Allowing second graph to conditionally RENDER as opposed to conditionally appear would be helpful.
