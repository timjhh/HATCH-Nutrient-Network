Accomplished:
Resizing graph, reverted both graphs to VisNetwork types. I also abstracted some methods for getting data for less complexity
I removed a lot of old code, and simplified some function calls
I added more layering to the bipartite graph, and found a way to highlight nodes more effectively.
The coloring seems buggy, but now nodes are distinctly viewable

Trying to accomplish:
Resizing nodes based on graph type, calling fewer methods to ascertain data.
I'd love to find a way to make bipartite graphs easier to read, and start them more zoomed in
It seems line thickness is also tricky, as you cannot go much thinner than the default - perhaps
changing opacity would be better?
Finally, I worked with the canvas size but failed to make it any bigger
