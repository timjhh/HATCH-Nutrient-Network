## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r setup}


# Load data
agData <- read.csv("../../DATA_INPUTS/Spatial_data_inputs/Afghanistan_ImportsGlobalConstrained_2019.csv")


nutrients <- data.frame(names(agData[12:37]))
colnames(nutrients) <- c("Nutrient")



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r tibbles, echo=FALSE}
tibble(nutrients)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
